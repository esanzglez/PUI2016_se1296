### I collaborated on this assignment with Sebastian Bana, Scott Smith, Ben Alpert, Luis Fernando Melchor, and Jonathan Geis.

### Task 1 required collapsing all the data into a single timeseries and identifying an event.
### Task 2 required collapsing the data into timeseries for each card type and identifying those with a steady upward or downward trend.
### Task 3 was to find the four stations with the most prominent annual trends in ridership.
