Question 1: Do diets help lose more fat than exercise?

    H0: P(diet) >= P(exercise)

Question 2: Do Americans trust the president?
    Null Hypothesis: The percentage of Americans who trust the president is the same or higher than the percentage of those who do not.
    H0: P(trust) >= P(distrust)    or H0: P(trust) >= 0.5

Question 3: Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
    Null Hypothesis: The percentage of smokers who have successfully quit smoking after three months of use of a nicotine patch is the same or less than the percentage of smokers who have successfully quit smoking after three months of use of a placebo patch. 
    H0: P(nicotine) <= P(placebo)
    
Question 4: Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
    Null Hypothesis: The average IQ of children aged 1-4 whose mothers smoked during pregnancy will be the same or higher as the average IQ of children aged 1-4 whose mothers did not smoke during pregnancy.
