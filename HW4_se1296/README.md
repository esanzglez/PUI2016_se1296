# HW 4

## Assignment 1: Review of Gregory Mayes Citibike Project Proposal

## Assignment 2: Literature Choices of Statistical Tests
I worked on this assignment with Sebastian Bana. He chose the t-test for 
differences between groups, and I chose path analysis for relationships
between dependent and independent variables. The research paper for the latter
is *Impact of Maternal Death on Household Economy in Rural China: A Prospective
Path Analysis* by Fang Ye, Deng Ao, Yao Feng, Lin Wang, Jie Chen, Dale Huntington,
Haijun Wang, and Yan Wang, and can be found at http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134756
