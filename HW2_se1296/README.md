###HW #2 for PUI2016, Thursday class

Author: Sofiya Elyukin, se1296

I collaborated with Sebastian Bana, Jonathan Geis, Luis Fernando Fernandez,
Ben Alpert, and Mark.
Sebastian and Fernando walked Jonathan and me through their scripts for the 
assignments, and we in turn walked Ben and Mark through the script for Assignment 1.

I went through actually writing my scripts for Assignments 2 and 3 on my own,
but took code from the examples provided and from Sebastian's and Fernando's scripts.
The comments in my scripts specify what sections of code were taken from where.
