HW ## for PUI2016

Author: SOfiya Elyukin

Individual work for both Assignment 1 and 2 was prefaced by a group discussion with
Ben Alpert, Sebastian Bana, Jonathan Geis, Fernando Melchor, and Scott Smith. We went
over the different types of distributions for Assignment 1, and formulated a null
hypothesis for Assignment 2. Code for the notebooks for both assignments was taken
from the examples provided in Professor Bianco's PUI2016 repository.
