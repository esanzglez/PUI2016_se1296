###HW #2 for PUI2016, Thursday class

Author: Sofiya Elyukin, se1296

I collaborated with Sebastian Bana, Jonathan Geis, Luis Fernando Melchor 
Fernandez,Ben Alpert, and Mark (not sure of last name). Actual coding for each
script here was done individually (but with code borrowing) after a breakdown
and discussion of a mostly complete script.

#### Assignment 1
Sebastian walked Jonathan, Fernando, and me through his script. Jonathan and I
later did the same for Ben and Mark. Specific instances of code-borrowing for 
my own script are specified in its comments.

#### Assignment 2
Sebastian walked Jonathan, Fernando, and me through his script. We then jointly
refined it, specifically to account for N/A values when retrieving information
on the next stop. Specific instances of code borrowing for my own script are
specified in its comments.

#### Assignment 3:
Fernando walked Sebastian, Jonathan, and me through his (then partial) script,
and we adjusted it to use the DFDATA environmental variable to retreive the
CSV file. Specific instances of code borrowing for my own script are specified
in its comments.
