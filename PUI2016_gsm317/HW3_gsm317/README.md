# Assignment 1
I plotted five distributions (normal, chi squared, binominal, poisson and leplace) using the example shown in "Assignment1.ipynb."
I then plotted the means of all distributions in a histogram plot to demonstrate the central mean thereom.

#Assignment 2
I formulated my idea using the Citi Bike data, which is that young adults are more likely to choose biking for their commute, and
developed the cooresponding null hypothesis. I developed code to download the zip data file from Citi Bike and extracted to a csv file,
but I was unable to get the PUIDATA environmental variable to work. The PUIDATA variable gave me an error measage that it pointed to a
directory that was the same as I defined in my .bashrc. Finally, I wrangled the data to include only the trip dates for subscribers between
25 and 44 years old.

#Assignment 3
I calculated the mean and standard deviation for the sample data from the new bus route. I think performed a z-test analysis and determined
that the new bus route is not faster within 2 standard deviations.
