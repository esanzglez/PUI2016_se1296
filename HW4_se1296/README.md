## Assignment 2: Literature Choices of Statistical Tests

I worked on this assignment with Sebastian Bana. He chose the t-test for differences between groups, and I chose path analysis for relationships between dependent and independent variables. The study I chose actually had two path analyses using the same independent variables and mediators, but different dependent variables.
