# PUI2016 HW2 - Gregory Mayes - Completed 9/21/16

## Assignment #1
### show_bus_locations_gsm317.py
This task was to develop a python script to be excuted from the command line to pull location information from a specific bus line using the MTA's API website. The data is then to be parsed and displayed on screen in the required format. I wrote the code to pull the data myself using "NYCweatherAPI.py" as an example. I then worked with Dana Karwas to write the second part of the script to display the desired information. We were able to pull and display the latitude and longitude information for all buses, but got stuck on the total and numbering of buses. To complete the assignment, I enlisted the help of a friend outside of class familar with python, Matt Hart, who I've credited in my code.

## Assignment #2
### get_bus_info_gsm317.py
This task is similar to assignment #1, with the exception that the specified data was to be outputted to a csv file. I wrote this script myself, reusing code from the previous assignment to pull data and "aSimplePythonThatWritesToCSV.py" as an example to output the csv file. I also modified code from a stackoverflow posting, which I've refenced it my code.

## Assignment #3
### HW2_As3_CSV_gsm317.ipynb
This task was to read a CSV file with pandas and perform data parsing and plotting, using a python notebook. I pulled data from the CUSP green environment related to NYC water supply reservoir levels and plotted a stage storage curve for the Rondout reservoir. To complete this assignment I used "readingData.ipynb" as an example.
