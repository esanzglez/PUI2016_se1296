## HW #3 for PUI2016

### Author: Sofiya Elyukin

Individual work for both Assignment 1 and 2 was prefaced by a group discussion with
Ben Alpert, Sebastian Bana, Jonathan Geis, Fernando Melchor, and Scott Smith. We went
over the different types of distributions for Assignment 1, and formulated a null
hypothesis for Assignment 2. Code for the notebooks for both assignments was taken
from the examples provided in Professor Bianco's PUI2016 repository. I also looked
through Sebastian's, Ben's, and Jonathan's codes in attempting to work through 
Assignment 2. Any specific lines of their code used in my assignment are specified
within the notebook.

I completed Assignment 3 on my own based on the slides and work done in class.

I had issues pushing Assignment 1 to github, and in the process lost the code and
plots for my histogram (granted, it had not rendered quite properly anyway.)
