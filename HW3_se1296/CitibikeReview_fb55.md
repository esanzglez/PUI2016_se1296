# Citibike mini project review by fb55

very good presentation, usage of markdown cells and style options!

## IDEA:

well justified and interesting

## Null hypothesis and alternative

Formulated correctly, but missing the mathematical formulation:

H0: N_rushWE/N_rushWD - N_norushWE/N_norushWD ...

## data wrangling

done fine but far from over: you have extracted the two variables you need but not processed them so that you can use (which is fine because the target of the wrangling phase was flexible, but needs to be done to finish the assignment)

from the date you have to go to weekday and weekend, separate the rush and non rush trips and consolidate the weekdays and weekends. then you can take the ratios you need and proceed with a **test of proportions** (e.g. chi sq)
